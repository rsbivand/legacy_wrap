## `classInt`: Choose Univariate Class Intervals

Selected commonly used methods for choosing univariate class intervals for mapping or other graphics purposes.

- repository: https://github.com/r-spatial/classInt

- CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/package=classInt

- maintenance status: Since the package is in the `r-spatial` organisation, others there can take over if necessary. It is imported by `sf`, `stars` and about 20 other packages, including `mapsf` and `tmap`

- documentation status: Currently one vignette covering one style, in addition to help pages: https://r-spatial.github.io/classInt. More is needed, abstract submitted to https://ucpages.uc.pt/events/ectqg2023/ for presentation, possible RJ submission. Co-author(s) would be helpful. Other mentions are rather scattered, so needs a _one-stop_ document.
