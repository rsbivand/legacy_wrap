## `spatialreg`: Spatial Regression Analysis

A collection of all the estimation functions for spatial cross-sectional models (on lattice/areal data using spatial weights matrices) contained up to now in 'spdep'. These model fitting functions include maximum likelihood methods for cross-sectional models proposed by 'Cliff' and 'Ord' (1973, ISBN:0850860369) and (1981, ISBN:0850860814), fitting methods initially described by 'Ord' (1975) https://doi.org/10.1080%2F01621459.1975.10480272. The models are further described by 'Anselin' (1988) https://doi.org/10.1007%2F978-94-015-7799-1. Spatial two stage least squares and spatial general method of moment models initially proposed by 'Kelejian' and 'Prucha' (1998) https://doi.org/10.1023%2FA%3A1007707430416 and (1999) https://doi.org/10.1111%2F1468-2354.00027 are provided. Impact methods and MCMC fitting methods proposed by 'LeSage' and 'Pace' (2009) https://doi.org/10.1201%2F9781420064254 are implemented for the family of cross-sectional spatial regression models. Methods for fitting the log determinant term in maximum likelihood and MCMC fitting are compared by 'Bivand et al.' (2013) https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fgean.12008 (also https://openaccess.nhh.no/nhh-xmlui/handle/11250/278934), and model fitting methods by 'Bivand' and 'Piras' (2015) https://doi.org/10.18637%2Fjss.v063.i18; both of these articles include extensive lists of references. A recent review is provided by 'Bivand', 'Millo' and 'Piras' (2021) https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fmath9111276. 'spatialreg' >= 1.1-* corresponded to 'spdep' >= 1.1-1, in which the model fitting functions were deprecated and passed through to 'spatialreg', but masked those in 'spatialreg'. From versions 1.2-*, the functions have been made defunct in 'spdep'.

- maintenance status: ongoing

- documentation status: SDSR chapter 17 https://r-spatial.org/book/17-Econometrics.html, Bivand, Millo and Piras (2021) https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fmath9111276 (including `sphet` and `splm`), https://r-spatial.github.io/spatialreg/, some vignettes. https://github.com/r-spatial/spatialreg/issues/27 requests documentation of methods used for computing the log determinant (as in Bivand et al. (2013), pre-print is OA, and could be summarised in markdown), and the use of a one-sided formula for creating Durbin terms (spatially lagged covariates). Recent materials include https://github.com/rsbivand/emos_talk_2304, including video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spYPyHxa7v8, but which is more about how to do spatial econometrics than guidance on use of functions in the package.
